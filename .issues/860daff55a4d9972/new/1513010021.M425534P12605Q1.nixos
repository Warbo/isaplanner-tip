Subject: Turn standalone tests into inline dependencies
Message-Id: <860daff55a4d9972-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Rather than having a standalone set of test derivations, we should put
each test alongside one of the derivations it uses, make a new
derivation which depends on that test and exposes that derivation.
